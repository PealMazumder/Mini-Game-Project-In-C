This is a simple Game with Basic Coding Style. :(


Mainly this game is based on that game which kids are usually play using their fingers like ROCK PAPER SCISSORS.
This game held between two players.He will give input first who batted first.Then the opponent player will give input.
If the opponent player's input matched with first player's input then the first player will be out.
Then second player will bat at the same way and first player try to out him.
For runs 1,2,3,4 and 6 press the key 'a'/'l','s'/'k','d'/'j','w'/'o'&'e'/'i' of keyboard respectively.
